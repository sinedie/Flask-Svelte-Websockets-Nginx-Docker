# Ultimate Flask websocket template

Created in a learning process and for quick development using websockets in microservices with docker

Mean to be as simple as possible. (KISS)

## Used technologies
- Flask-SocketIO
- Flask-SQLAlchemy
- Gunicorn
- Celery
- Redis
- Postgres
- Routify / Svelte
- Nginx

## TODO
- Create a CRUD to test database
- Sesion management (could be Flask-Login) but Flask-JWT is preferred
- Mail sending with Flask-Mail
